loader must be avalible when the power is turned on and when the reset swich is fliped
the loader is used to "warm start" the operating system if it was running before
Warm start is used at the end of a program to reload CP/M
Each computer needs a different version of CP/M because the memory and port addresses might be different

A floppy disk sector held 128 bytes and were called records
256 bytes were called pages or blocks
1k bytes were called groups
Minimim incriment of disk space is 1k bytes, meaning that a 1 byte file still takes up 1k bytes on the disk, 1025 byte file takes up 2 groups, ect...
BDOS ERR ON B: BAD SECTOR (there was an error reading the disk, carriage return to ignore or CRTL C to reboot)
BDOS ERR ON R: SELECT (the program is lost and the drive is garbaged, restart the computer)
Always backup/save your programs
CP/M seems to jump aronud a lot because it was written for a minimum computer with 16k bytes
